title: "Inferring parameters of cancer evolution from sequencing and clinical data"
abstract: "As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. We apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Fitting our model to longitudinal patient data reveals that the first driver mutation typically occurs very early in life in patients that go on to develop CLL, and that the appearance of the first driver mutation and the diagnosis of CLL are typically separated by 30-50 years."
