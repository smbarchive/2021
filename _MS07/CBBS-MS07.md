title: " Wave propagation and pattern formation phenomena in     biological models"

description: "Pattern formation is a fundamental phenomenon ubiquitous in many branches
of natural sciences, like physics, chemistry, geography, biology, and also
in social sciences. It is a paradigm that pattern formation processes are
a sine qua non condition for life origin, because they enable the
formation of germ layers, tissues and then highly specified organs, like
skin, bones, brain or heart. Moreover, similar spatial patterning occur
inside cells as a result of, e.g. response to external stimuli. It is thus
extremely intriguing to design mathematical models which are able to
explain, how (and under what conditions) the spatial patterns can be
developed. Very often the patterning phenomena  are carried out via
traveling waves, which can be pinned (stopped), in particular, due to
geometrical properties, like a local curvature of the boundary or growth
of the region.

Biological models leading to formation of patterns and/or  wave
propagation can shed an explanatory light and provide a lot information
about the evolution and the final (asymptotic) states of the systems
corresponding  to many phenomena in  embryology, virus spreading or tumour
dynamics."

title1: "On the spreading front arising in mathematical models of population dynamics"
abstract1: "Understanding the invasion processes of biological species is a
fundamental issue in ecology. Several mathematical models have been
proposed to estimate the spreading speed of species. In recent
decades, it was reported that some mathematical models of population
dynamics have an explicit form of the evolution equations for the
spreading front, which are represented by free boundary problems such
as the Stefan-like problem. To understand the formation of the
spreading front, we consider the singular limit of reaction-diffusion
models and give some interpretations for spreading front from the
viewpoint of modeling."

title2: "Chemical signalling and pattern formation in predator-prey models"
abstract2: "Chemical signalling is an ubiquitous  mechanism which impacts distribution
of species in space and time . Its role seems to be crucial in  the case
of  patterning  in homogeneous landscapes. Many chemicals (e.g.
pheromones,  kairomones)  released  by plants and animals are used as means of inter
and intraspecific communication. Olfaction is a primary means by which prey
 detect predators  and trigger anti-predator responses. In this talk based
on joint papers with Purnedu Mishra we consider the role of repulsive
chemotaxis in predator-prey models and using qualitative analytical
methods and simulations show complex behaviour of solutions depending on model
structure and parameters."

title3: "Traveling and standing fronts on curved surfaces"
abstract3: "We analyze heteroclinic traveling waves propagating on two dimensional
manifolds to show that the geometric modification of the front velocity is
proportional to the geodesic curvature of the front line. As a result, on
surfaces of concave domains, stable standing fronts can be formed on lines
of constant geodesic curvature. These lines minimize the geometric functional
describing the system’s energy, consisting of terms proportional to the
front line-length and to the inclosed surface area. Front stabilization at
portions of surface with negative Gaussian curvature, provides a mechanism
of pattern formation. In contrast to the mechanism associated with the Turing
instability, the proposed mechanism requires only a single scalar bistable
reaction–diffusion equation and connects the intrinsic surface geometry
with the arising pattern. By considering a system of equations modeling
boundary-volume interactions, we show that polarization of the boundary
may induce a corresponding polarization in the volume."

title4: "Modeling interplay of pattern formation and cell phenotype transitions during limb cartilage formation"
abstract4: "A regulatory network consisting of two  galactoside-binding proteins,
galectins  Gal-1A and Gal-8 and their counterreceptors, mediates the
spatial patterning  of the avian limb skeleton through the patterned
morphogenesis of mesenchymal  condensations. Formation of the pattern can
be modeled as a reaction-diffusion-adhesion process, wherein the galectins
form a mutually self-enhancing expression network via the respective
counterreceptors, while their diffusion, Gal-1A-mediated cell adhesion and
its antagonism  by Gal-8 determines the spatial separation of mesenchymal
protocondensations. A mathematical consists of a system of parabolic PDEs
with nonlocal advection terms that model cell-cell adhesion. Apart from
generating spatial patterns, the dynamical system of the underlying
galectin reaction network is interesting in its own right and can be
completely examined with analytical means. We identify two stable steady
states: where the concentrations of both the galectins are respectively,
negligible and very high.  We give an explicit Lyapunov function, which
shows that there are no periodic solutions. Our model therefore predicts
that the galectin network may exist in low expression and high expression
states separated in space or time without any intermediate states.  We
verify these predictions in experiments  performed with high density
micromass cultures of chick limb mesenchymal cells and observe that cells
inside and outside the precartilage protocondensations exhibit distinct
behaviors with respect to galectin expression, motility, and spreading.
The interactional complexity of the Gal-1 and -8-based  patterning network
is therefore sufficient to partition the mesenchymal cell population into
two discrete cell-types, which can be spatially patterned when
incorporated into a diffusion-enabled system."
