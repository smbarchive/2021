description: "Over the last fifty years, evolutionary game theory has become a powerful and versatile mathematical framework for the modelling, analysis and computation/simulation of complex biological, economic and social systems whenever there is frequency dependent selection. Environmental conditions are often subject to rapid and frequent fluctuations. Therefore, in many practical applications, one can neither obtain full information about the systems nor describe the payoffs of their inhabitants’ interactions. It is thus of vital importance to take into account randomness/uncertainty into the systems’ modelling. The randomness/uncertainty often poses significant challenges compared to deterministic models demanding for the development of new methodology and techniques which often involve stochastic processes on complex systems. This direction of research has seen a tremendous activity in the last two decades.

The aim of this mini-symposium is to discuss recent developments in evolutionary game theory where uncertainty plays a crucial role. It will bring together a diverse list of speakers, including young and female scientists, from different fields of research including biological sciences, computer sciences, economics and mathematics to address the difficult challenges that are currently presented in these fields. Thus, this mini-symposium will boost the interactions and collaborations between researchers from different fields."
