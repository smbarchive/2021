		    			Variation in cognition can influence how individuals respond to and communicate about their environment, which may scale to shape how a collective solves a cognitive task. However, few empirical examples of variation in collective cognition emerges from variation in individual cognition exist. Here, I show that interactions among individuals that differ in the performance of a cognitive task drives collective foraging behavior in honey bee colonies by utilizing a naturally variable and heritable learning behavior called latent inhibition (LI). I artificially selected two distinct phenotypes: high LI bees that are better at ignoring previously unrewarding familiar stimuli, and low LI bees that can learn previously unrewarding and novel stimuli equally well. I then provided colonies composed of these distinct phenotypes with a choice between a familiar feeder or a novel feeder. Colonies of high LI individuals preferred to visit familiar food locations, while low LI colonies visited novel and familiar food locations equally. However, in colonies of mixed learning phenotypes, the low LI bees showed a preference to visiting familiar feeders, which contrasts with their behavior when in a uniform low LI group. I show that the shift in feeder preference of low LI bees is driven by foragers of the high LI phenotype dancing more intensely and attracting more followers. I also present potential mechanisms that may be mediating the individual variation. These results reveal that cognitive abilities of individuals and their interactions drive emergent collective outcomes in social insects.

		    			The vast majority of mathematical models of honeybee diseases is for single colonies that have  no interaction with other colonies. This misses an important aspect of the ecoepidemiology in an apiary.  For an earlier model of nosemosis with direct and indirect transmission routes we formulate a metapopulation model that accounts for the transmission of the disease between colonies by drifting.  Since even the underlying single hive model is too complex for a thorough rigorous analysis, we explore the model in extensive numerical simulations. Our results suggest that for the model at hand the spread of the disease in the apiary is primarily controlled by seasonal effects, whereas the actual drifting rate has little quantitative effect.

		    			To survive, animals need to find resources and make decisions about which resource patches to invest time in exploiting. Balancing these tasks can be a complex decision-making challenge, particularly when patches are rapidly changing, heterogeneously distributed, and variable in quality. Social insects, such as honeybees, navigate this challenge in the absence of centralized control by allocating different individuals to exploration or exploitation based on differences in individual behavior. To investigate how differences in individual learning affect a colony’s collective ability to locate and choose among different quality food resources, we develop an agent-based model and test its predictions empirically using two genetic lines of honey bees (Apis mellifera), selected for differences in their learning behavior. We show that colonies containing individuals that are better at learning to ignore unrewarding stimuli are worse at collectively choosing the highest quality resource. This work highlights how differences in individual behavior may have unexpected consequences for the emergence of collective behavior.

		    			Biotic and abiotic factors can exert stress on honey bee colonies and limit their growth ultimately causing colony death. A colony population dynamics model was used to predict effects on colony growth of pesticide stress exerted during different times of year. Poor queen quality and infestation by parasitic Varroa mites were added into the simulations to determine the impact of multiple stress factors on colony growth and survival. The model predicts that colony survival after pesticide exposure depends on the time of year when exposure occurred. Poor queen quality makes colonies more vulnerable to loss from pesticide exposure as do high infestations of Varroa mites. Predictions highlight the difficulties is assigning causation of colony loss to a single factor.
