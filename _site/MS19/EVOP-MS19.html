		    			During an outbreak, public health data typically consist of time series for the daily or weekly incidence (reported new cases) of the disease. This information is location-specific (e.g. at the level of a county, a state, or a country) and noisy. For each such time series, plotting incidence as a function of cumulative cases instead of time leads to a remarkable simplification: the data appear to fluctuate about a mean curve of universal shape. In this talk, I will illustrate the previous statement through examples of Influenza A and COVID-19 outbreaks, and describe recent work aimed at elucidating this behavior [1, 2]. In particular, exact results will be provided for the deterministic and stochastic SIR models. In addition, I will explain how this property can be combined with data assimilation to provide short-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US [3]. This is joint work with Hannh Biegel, Bill Fries, Faryad Sahneh, and Joe Watkins.

		    			Seasonal influenza viruses create a persistent global disease burden by evolving to escape immunity induced by prior infections and vaccinations. New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter well-matched mucosal antibodies in previously-infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within-host, and providing a clear example of how evolution and ecology only make sense in light of one another.

	    		<article class="article-post text-justify" style="font-size:12px;">
		    		
		    			Complex population structures are an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of mutants. In fragmented populations, this has been studied using metapopulation models, which have been of great interest for questions related to ecology and population conservation. However, such models also have high relevance in a biomedical context – such as deme population structures that apply to evolution in hematopoietic systems. In this talk, we investigate the effects of population fragmentation on mutant cell dynamics using stochastic metapopulation modeling in conjunction with in vitro laboratory experiments. In the case of neutral mutations, we find that migration makes the demes look homogeneous to each other, resulting in a one-humped (unimodal) distribution, which matches well with experimental simulations. For disadvantageous mutations, we find that migration not only similarly impacts the distribution of mutant cells, but it can also change the expected frequency of mutants at stationary state compared to the selection-mutation balance. This could play an important role in disease progression.

	    		<article class="article-post text-justify" style="font-size:12px;">
		    		
		    			Despite intense therapeutic advances, therapy failures in diverse cancers may suggest the existence of intra-tumoral diversity and presumably rare subclones of minimal residual disease that are persistent to current therapies. Although there is no comprehensive technique to determine such subclones and to identify evolution of the disease, single-cell data can shed light on intra-cellular heterogeneity and clonal evolution of individual cells in alternative cell contexts. Utilizing single-cell data, the potential genetic pathways can be detected across diverse pheno/geno-types within a heterogeneous population of cells. Moreover, in many cancers, particularly in Multiple Myeloma, the most reliable clonal features are copy number variations (CNVs) which can be best inferred from single-cell DNA/RNA study. To address all these challenges, we developed an extensive pipeline, referred to as sciCNV, which covers a range of analysis from a novel normalization to inferring CNV from single-cell data. During this talk, we first introduce some fundamental tools which are commonly used in studying single cells and then will introduce the sciCNV pipeline to be implemented to segregate tumor cells from normal individuals and to understand the genetic background of the disease. This technique may offer an efficient way to clone distinct CNV-compartments and to construct a phylogeny of subclonal structure and pathogenesis of the disease. Such analysis can reflect evolutionary dynamics and clonal dependencies of cancer in time/space frame. Our approach is general and can be applied to any transcription data and may tend to a better understanding of histological/pathogenesis of diverse cancers and their associated therapeutic strategies.
