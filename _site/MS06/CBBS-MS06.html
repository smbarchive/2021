		    			Unicellular microorganisms are unicellular in the sense, that each individual is able to establish a new population. However, populations of microorganisms are not limited to a collection of individuals, but are highly organized so that the group can perform better than the sum of its individuals. In this presentation, we'll explore how the  asymmetric distribution of adhesins on single rod-shaped bacteria shapes the organization of the group and how this affects higher level functions.

		    			Bacteria are abundant organisms whose roles are included in many processes such as medicine, agriculture, ecology, industry... From a single organism, they quickly develop into organised micro-colonies and biofilm structures. The formation of these microcolonies, while broadly studied in the past decade, is still poorly understood.  We consider an individual-based model where each bacterium is modelled by a spherocylinder and bacteria interact only through non-overlapping constraints.  Introducing asymmetric friction and mass for the bacterium, which are taking into account the asymmetry of the pole of the bacteria, we retrieve mechanical behaviours of micro-colony growth, this without implementing attraction or adhesion. We compare our model to various sets of experiments, discuss our results, and propose several quantifiers to compare model to data in a systematic way.

		    			Myxobacteria are rod-shaped, social bacteria that are able to move on flat surfaces by ’gliding’ and form a fascinating example of how simple cell-cell interaction rules can lead to emergent, collective behavior. Observed movement patterns of individual bacteria in such a colony include straight runs with approximately constant velocity, alignment interactions and velocity reversals.  Experimental evidence shows that above mentioned behavior is a consequence of direct cell-contact interaction rather than diffusion of chemical signals, which indicates the suitability of kinetic modeling. In this talk a new kinetic model of Boltzmann-type for such colonies of myxobacteria will be introduced and investigated. For the spatially homogeneous case an existence and uniqueness result will be shown, as well as exponential decay to an equilibrium for the Maxwellian collision operator. The methods used for the analysis combine several tools from kinetic theory, entropy methods as well as optimal transport. The talk will be concluded with numerical simulations confirming the analytical results.

		    			We consider the problem of detecting or estimating the interaction in a large system of particles over a fixed time horizon. The particles are subject to a common external force and diffusion, and they interact via a smooth interaction kernel in a mean-field sense, and possibly via a common noise term. We identify some properties of the model that enables one to identify the presence of interactions, in a large population limit, from a statistical perspective.
