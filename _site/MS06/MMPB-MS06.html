		    			Timely diagnosis of dementia is a policy priority in the United Kingdom (UK). However, recent research shows that a third to a half of patients with dementia do not have a diagnosis recorded in their primary care patient record, and for those that get a diagnosis, it takes over three years for the diagnosis to be made. We explored using modelling to automate early detection of dementia using data from electronic health records (EHRs). We investigated: a) how early a machine-learning model could accurately identify dementia before the physician; b) if models could be tuned for dementia subtype; and c) what the best clinical features were for achieving detection. Using EHRs from Clinical Practice Research Datalink in a case-control design, we selected patients aged >65y with a diagnosis of dementia recorded 2000-2012 (cases) and matched them 1:1 to controls, giving a total of 95k patients. We trained random forest classifiers, and evaluated models using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). We examined models by year prior to diagnosis, dementia subtype, and the most important features contributing to classification. Classification of dementia cases and controls was poor 2-5 years prior to physician-recorded diagnosis but good in the year before. Features indicating increasing cognitive and physical frailty dominated models 2-5 years before diagnosis; in the final year, initiation of the dementia diagnostic pathway (memory loss symptoms, screening and referral) explained the sudden increase in accuracy. This leads us to think that automated detection of dementia earlier than the treating physician may be problematic using only primary care data, and that linking multiple sources of healthcare data could improve model performance.

		    			The most devastating infectious disease epidemics are those that have a wide geographical range, as opposed to being confined to a small region. Early in the COVID-19 epidemic, an important question was whether or not SARS-CoV-2 would spread elsewhere and cause local outbreaks outside of China. A vital factor was the probability of establishment whenever a pathogen arrives in a new location, since this is a key component of any pathogens pandemic potential. We assessed this in real-time during the COVID- 19 epidemic. In this talk, we show how the probability of sustained transmission in other locations can be estimated from data that are available during infectious disease outbreaks. We show how estimates can be extended to include features such as transmission from paucisymptomatic infectors (infectious individuals with few symptoms). If time allows, we will also show how estimates can be generated for other pathogens and other epidemiological settings.

		    			Deep tissue injury is often followed by contraction of the scar. This contraction is caused by the pulling forces exerted by myofibroblasts and fibroblasts, which are cells that are responsible for the regeneration of collagen. In this talk, we will review several mechanical frameworks, such as viscoelasticity and morpho- elasticity, in which the latter framework can be used to simulate plastic deformations. Furthermore, we will consider cell-based as well as continuum simulation frameworks and some remarks about our upscaling efforts will be given. These upscaling strategies currently incorporate the relation between the use of the immerse boundary method and smoothed particle approach. Since many input parameters are patient-dependent, we will also present some results from the quantification of uncertainty that we have carried out.

		    			Combining MRI techniques with modelling is rapidly gaining attention as a promising method for staging of brain gliomas. This study assesses the diagnostic value of such a framework applied to stratify- ing treatment-nave gliomas from a multi-center patients into WHO grades II-IV and across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. 333 patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary gliomas were retrospectively identified. Shape, intensity distribution and tex- ture features over the tumour mask were extracted. A random-forest algorithm was employed (2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted features. Shape, distribution and texture features showed significant differences across mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another. Gliomas were correctly stratified by mutation status in 71% and by grade in 53% of the cases (87% of the gliomas grades predicted with distance less than 1). Combining brain radiomics with modelling presents a promising approach for non-invasive glioma molecular subtyping and grading.
