		    			Collective movement is a very common occurrence in biology and ecology. I will review work in which I have been involved for the past few years on (i) angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) in wound healing and cancer growth; (ii) cranial neural crest migration in normal development. The models will range from coupled systems of partial differential equations to discrete cell-based systems. I will show how we have derived a new model for the classical snail-trail system and also how, working with experimental colleagues, we have generated new biological insights.

We use these models to explore the dynamics of mosquito behaviour on malaria transmission and investigate the impact of vector control interventions on malaria transmission and disease burden.

		    			The successful reduction in prevalence rates of HIV in many countries is attributed to control measures such as information and education campaigns (IEC), antiretroviral therapy (ART), and national, multinational and multilateral support providing official developmental assistance (ODAs) to combat HIV. However, control of HIV epidemics can be interrupted by limited random supply of ODAs, high poverty rates and low living standards. This study presents a stochastic HIV/AIDS model with treatment assessing the roles of IEC, the supply of ODAs and early treatment in HIV epidemics. The supply of ODAs is assessed via the availability of medical and financial resources leading more people to get tested and begin early ART. The basic reproduction number ( $mathfrak{R}_{0}$) for the dynamics is obtained, and other results for HIV control are obtained by conducting stability analysis for the stochastic SITRZ disease dynamics. Moreover, the model is applied to Uganda HIV/AIDS data, wherein linear regression is applied to predict the $mathfrak{R}_{0}$ over time, and to determine the importance of ART treatment in the dynamics.

		    			The Next Generation Matrix method has been one of the most popular methods for establishing the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. It has, however, some drawbacks - for instance it is not directly applicable for problems with the immigration of infectives. In this talk, we shall discuss some ways of dealing with such problems, based on perturbation techniques.
