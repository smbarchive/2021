		    			Accurate cell/nuclei segmentation and tracking play an important role in time-lapse 3D microscopy image analysis. Features of interest often depend on precise localization of 3D points on the boundary. Towards this, we present a deep network coupled with a conditional random field model for cell segmentation of 3D confocal membrane tagged image stacks, and a supervoxel based segmentation of 3D nuclei tagged images with few annotations. To track these segmented cells/nuclei, a computationally efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes the relative cell/nuclei location while maintaining tracking accuracy. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods on large 3d time-lapse imagery.

		    			DNA damage signaling is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fate decision. Our genome is constantly under assault by various endogenous and environmental agents, exposure of UV rays and even routine DNA replication can cause obstruction of replication or transcription. The DNA damage response is a highly integrated signaling network has a set of mechanism that can detect the type of severity of DNA damage to initiate repair or apoptosis. This talk will describe methodologies used to investigate p53 protein activity and alteration of the metabolic pathway upon DNA damage.  Here we present 2-Photon excitation laser microirradiation to induce different types of DNA damage, the Number and Molecular Brightness (N&B) method to map aggregation, and the phasor approach to FLIM to map metabolic changes upon DNA damage. Overall, our findings demonstrate that by multiplexing these techniques we have the ability to spatially and temporally quantify p53 activation and map p53‚Äôs influence in the metabolic pathway.

		    			We present a method for learning ``spectrally descriptive'' edge weights for graphs. We generalize a previously known distance measure between graphs (Graph Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network model to learn edge weights to minimize loss. We demonstrate this by applying this metric to two groups of graphs derived from samples from two genotypes of Arabidopsis. GDD by itself cannot distinguish between these two categories of graphs. However, training edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned distance metric with large margins between graph categories. We demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also demonstrate further applications of this technique.

		    			The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is continually derived from a population of stem cells located at the growing tip of the plants. These stem cells shed off populations of daughter cells both radially and basally. As the daughter cells are displaced, they undergo increased cell division rates and changes in gene expression critical to determine the SAM structure and shape.  The cell division rates and changes in gene expression occur at a certain distance along the transcription factor-WUSCHEL and plant hormone cytokinin signaling domains. In addition, the cell division and gene expression are compromised in wuschel and cytokinin signaling mutants, suggesting these chemical signals regulate cell division rates. The changes in cell division rates and displacement of daughter cells affects the structure and shape of local cells and ultimately the SAM as a whole. Through a combination of transient gene expression, quantitative image analysis and biologically-calibrated computational model simulations we test the possible mechanisms regulating cell division to determine the SAM structure.  Our analysis suggests that WUSCHEL, cytokinin, and mechanical stress regulate patterns of cell expansion and cell division plane orientation in a layer specific fashion to maintain the layered structure and shape of SAMs which are critical for stem cell homeostasis.
