		    			Cells may attain various shapes and sizes. It has been widely documented that cell geometry influences cellular activities like cell growth and death, cell mobility and adhesion to the direct environment. The shape of a motile cell is determined by its boundaries, which dynamically vary with a local balance between retraction and protrusion. During wound healing, epidermal cells alter their shape for re-epithelialization and fibroblasts (spindle shape) differentiate into myofibroblasts (dendric shape) to regenerate collagen bundles in the extracellular matrix, while they exert traction forces causing skin contraction. For cancer cell metastasis, which is the main reason of death of cancer patients, cancer cells need to deform in order to migrate through and around obstacles during invasion and they are observed to apply traction forces on their immediate environment.
We developed a phenomenological model to simulate cell shape evolution during cell migration, based on the work in [1] and [2], where the traction forces exerted by the cells were not yet considered. Plastic deformations of the direct environment of the cells are modeled by morphoelasticity theory and point forces, which result into partial differential equations describing the momentum balance with Dirac Delta distributions for point forces over the boundary elements of the cells. The partial differential equations are solved by finite-element methods.  In our model, the cell membrane is split into line segments by nodal points, and each point is connected to the cell center by an elastic spring to maintain the cell cytoskeleton (see Figure 1). Together with chemotaxis/mechanotaxis, passive convection and random walk, the displacement of the nodal point is determined. Hence, the cell shape evolves over time during cell migration.
To validate the model, we managed to reproduce the most important trends observed in the experiment in [3]. The model can be applied to mimic various (microscopic) biological observations with several equilibrium shapes of cell, for instance, circular, elliptic and hypercloid-shaped. These equilibrium shapes are characteristic for the phenotype of the cell. Furthermore, the current model provides a basis that can be expanded to describe more experimentally observed phenomena in cell geometry. For more details about this part of work, we refer to [4].

		    			Diabetic kidney disease is a significant health burden in the US and worldwide. During diabetic kidney disease collagen deposition occurs in the mesangium, a tissue located at the center of the filtration unit of the kidney. The collagen deposition that occurs in the mesangium changes the transport property of the matrix, and, therefore, the ability of signaling molecules to traverse through that medium. The extent to which collagen deposition impacts the ability of glomerular cells to communicate has not been previously investigated. Using established models, we investigated whether collagen deposition impacts glomerular cell communication. We hypothesize that the pathological deposition of collagen decreases the ability of glomerular cells to communicate.
Our model predicted that collagen deposition enhances the signaling range of the mesangial cell. This enhancement can disrupt the controlled, localized inter-cellular signaling that occurs in health and thus contribute to the exacerbation of diabetic kidney damage. Previously, many models have been developed to study the parameters that impact the signaling range of cells, however, the mathematical interrogation of inter-cellular signaling in the context of diabetic kidney damage has not been previously done. The novel insight gained from this mathematical study enhances our understanding of how pathological tissue damage induced by diabetes contributes to the disruption of cellular function.

		    			Local cancer invasion of tissue is a complex, multiscale process which plays an essential role in tumour progression. During the interaction between cancer cell population and the extracellular matrix (ECM), of key importance is the role played by both bulk two-scale dynamics of ECM fibres within collective movement of the tumour cells and the multiscale leading-edge dynamics driven by proteolytic activity of the matrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) that are secreted by the cancer cells. We focus on understanding the cell-scale cross talk between the micro-scale parts of these two multiscale subsystems which get to interact directly in the peritumoural region, with immediate consequences both for MDE micro-dynamics occurring at the leading edge of the tumour and for the cell-scale rearrangement of the naturally oriented ECM fibres in the peritumoural region, ultimately influencing the way a tumour progresses in the surrounding tissue.

		    			Progression from a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to an invasive tumor is a major step initiating a devastating and often lethal metastatic cascade. One sentinel event that initiate this process is the development of ductal microinvasions, i.e., small cohorts of tumor cells that breach the basement membrane surrounding the duct and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to irreversible changes in tumor and stromal architecture. We used a combination of advanced image analysis techniques applied to patients’ histology data to extract features which identify specific properties of individual tumor cells inside the duct and on the invasive front. By integrating these histology-based data with a hybrid agent-based mathematical model, we investigated the biomechanical interactions between the cells and the ECM fiber architecture, and microenvironmental physical and metabolic features that define tumor niche prone to microinvasions.
