		    			One of the major challenges in biology concerns the integration of data across length and time scales into a consistent framework: how do macroscopic properties and functionalities arise from the molecular regulatory networks and how do they evolve? Morphogenesis provides an excellent model system to study how simple molecular networks robustly control complex pattern forming processes and how mechanical constraints shape organs. In my talk, I will focus on self-organizing principles in organogenesis, with a particular focus on lung and kidney development, as well as on epithelial organisation.

		    			Wing imaginal disc of Drosophila is one of the commonly used model systems for the studies of patterning, growth, and scaling. The development of the wing disc involves many interacting components as well as a variety of compound processes whose underlying mechanisms are still under investigation. For instance, it remains unclear about how to form compound experimentally-measured patterns of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) type-I receptor Thickveins (Tkv), as well as phosphorylated Mothers Against Dpp (pMad) which is the indicator of Dpp signaling activities. In this work, we proposed mathematical models that integrate established experimental data to investigate the formation of pMad and Tkv gradients. Our model is validated by the accurate reproduction of complex asymmetric profiles of Tkv and pMad in both anterior and posterior compartments of the wing disc.  Moreover, it provides a comprehensive view of the formation of Tkv gradients in wing discs. We found that engrailed (En), Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and Dpp signaling cooperate to establish the asymmetric gradients of  Tkv and pMad in the wing disc. Finally, our model suggests a Brinker-mediated mechanism of Dpp-dependent repression of Tkv.

		    			The fibrous protein collagen is the main protein in mammalian connective tissue.  Although the properties of a collagen filament are well understood, how they come together to form tissues with vastly different properties is not.  In this talk, with the aid of a mathematical model, we will explore properties of a fibrous tissue and determine their impact on the elasticity of the tissue.
