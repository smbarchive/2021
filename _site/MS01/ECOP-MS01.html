		    			In the late 1950s, it was discovered that factor on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster produced extreme departure from Mendelian segregation in males. This segregation distorter (SD) factor reached a frequency as high as 30 percent in some populations. In small isolated populations of Mus musculus a similar phenomenon, the t-factor, was found to be produce strong segregation distortion as well as infertility in males. Even earlier, segregation distortion has been observed in the XY sex determination of Drosophila pseudoobscura. In all cases models for the balance of pre- and post-zygotic types of selection were invoked to explain the existence of polymorphism for these “anti-Darwinian” meiotic drive phenomena. Dynamics of evolutionary genetic systems with Mendelian segregation are very special, and most well-known results in population genetic theory do not apply if there is meiotic drive. Modern approaches to gene-drive analysis have their antecedent in this early research.

		    			Synthetic gene drives are a marvel at par with any other technologies with a capacity for massive global impact. However, the discussion about drive control or intervention dilemmas is not at the same level as with some other technologies that are further behind but overhyped, such as generalized AI. With mathematical models, we show the resultant dynamics of synthetic drive technologies given the forces ecological forces they may face in the wild- particularly mate choice, different mating systems and structured populations. We assess the risk of the drive succeeding, failing or going rogue. In closing, we discuss the control problem from AI while simultaneously acknowledging the differences between artificial and natural selection

		    			Rapid evolutionary processes can produce drastically different outcomes when studied in panmictic population models vs. spatial models. One such process is gene drive, which describes the spread of “selfish” genetic elements through a population. Engineered gene drives are being considered for the suppression of disease vectors or invasive species. While laboratory experiments and modelling in panmictic populations have shown that such drives can rapidly eliminate a population, it remains unclear if these results translate to natural environments where individuals inhabit a continuous landscape. Using spatially explicit simulations, we show that the release of a suppression drive can result in what we term “chasing” dynamics, in which wild‐type individuals recolonize areas where the drive has locally eliminated the population. Despite the drive subsequently reconquering these areas, complete population suppression often fails to occur or is substantially delayed. This increases the likelihood that the drive is lost or that resistance evolves. We analyze how chasing dynamics are influenced by the type of drive, its efficiency, fitness costs, and ecological factors such as the maximal growth rate of the population and levels of dispersal and inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that the population dynamics of suppression gene drives are determined by a complex interplay of genetic and ecological factors, highlighting the need for realistic spatial modelling to predict the outcome of drive releases in natural populations.

		    			Despite significant reductions in malaria incidence and prevalence over the last decade following the wide-spread distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, malaria is not expected to be eliminated with currently available tools. Consequently, there is interest in novel interventions that complement existing ones, including gene drive-modified mosquitoes. Mathematical modeling has a central role to play in determining the impact that gene drive systems could have, alongside other interventions, towards the goal of malaria elimination. In this talk, we survey modeling priorities as gene drive mosquito projects advance from the lab to the field. We begin by highlighting priorities in model building, including: i) capturing nuances in the inheritance-biasing impacts of gene drive systems, ii) incorporating data and insights on mosquito vector ecology, including life history, habitat distribution and movement patterns, and iii) aligning entomological models with detailed models of malaria transmission, including the impacts of currently available and novel interventions. We then highlight several priorities in model application as gene drive products advance from the lab to the field. These include informing target product profiles for gene drive products to assess when they satisfy safety and efficacy criteria, and informing the design of cage trials, field trials and eventually vector and disease control interventions. Other priorities include developing monitoring programs to assess the safety and efficacy of trials and interventions, developing surveillance programs to detect unintended spread, and addressing risk and regulatory questions requiring a quantitative analysis.
