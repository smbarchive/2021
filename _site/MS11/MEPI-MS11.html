		    			Background: In the absence of a vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been controlled by preventing person-to-person interactions via social distancing measures. As vaccination is rolled out and social distancing restrictions are lifted, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. Methods: We use age-specific social contact data collect in the UK in 2010, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies and vaccination rollout on the reproduction number in the UK. Results: We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). Transmission associated with primary schools is predicted to have a smaller impact on community prevalence than transmission in secondary schools. Prioritising older age groups for vaccination leads to modest initial indirect benefits of vaccination. Some levels of contact tracing and COVID security are required until the majority of the adult population are vaccinated. The results can be explored at https://ellenbp.shinyapps.io/reckoners/.  Conclusions: Our approach has been widely used by policy-makers to project the impact of social distancing measures and assess the trade-offs between them. Effective social distancing, contact tracing and COVID-security are required while vaccination is rolled out.

		    			The Australian COVID-19 pandemic experience has been characterised by long periods of no transmission interspersed with localised, and mostly small outbreaks linked to spillover from quarantine facilities for international arrivals. COVID-19 preparedness and response decision making in Australia has therefore been focused on the potential for outbreaks to take-off and the likely impact of interventions on preventing that. However in the absence of cases, standard models for estimating the reproduction rate of the virus cannot be used. We will detail a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian statistical model developed to track COVID-19 transmission potential in Australia over time. This quantity can be tracked even in the absence of cases by drawing on mobility data streams, behavioural surveys, and data on health surveillance systems. The effects of lockdowns, varying adherence to hygiene measures, age-structured vaccination roll-out, variants with different transmissibility, and the effectiveness of health surveillance systems are all explicitly considered. This model is able to track the potential rate of transmission in the absence of cases, the realised rate of transmission in the presence of cases, and to move smoothly between these metrics. A particular advantage of this approach for the Australian context is the ability to derive estimates of transmission rates in the very early stages of an outbreak, when numbers of cases are still in the single figures. This model has informed the Australian response to COVID-19 throughout the pandemic - as discussed in a separate talk by Dr Freya Shearer at this conference.

		    			The morbidity caused by an acute infectious disease like COVID-19 is frequently measured only with respect to the short-term effects of infection. We consider an important longer-term effect, namely the deterioration of immune functioning due to accelerated senescence of pathogen-responsive T cells. Using both mathematics and data, we argue that this type of immune deterioration is negligible in young adults but substantial in older adults. A consideration that emerges in the current context of a limited COVID-19 vaccine supply is how to optimize vaccination in order to minimize such immune deterioration. We show that, compared to alternative vaccination strategies, prioritizing older adults as well as individuals who have an already significantly deteriorated immune functioning is optimal. Because, as we argue using data, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections increases with immune deterioration, this vaccination strategy would also save the most lives. Our mathematical framework offers a natural explanation for the higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced death that has been observed in men compared to women.
