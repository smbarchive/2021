		    			Melanoma is one of the most aggressive and highly resistant tumor. Cell plasticity in
melanoma is one the main reason behind its metastatic capacity. I will discuss the recent
results obtained by our group on cellular plasticity and CSCs in melanoma. The detailed
molecular mechanisms controlling melanoma plasticity are still not completely understood.
We combine mathematical models of phenotypic switching with experiments on IgR39
human melanoma cell line to identify possible key targets to impair phenotypic switching.
Our results shed new light on melanoma plasticity providing a potential target and guidance
for therapeutic studies

		    			The probability to achieve an objective response with anti-BRAF+MEK therapy in patients with BRAFV600E/K mutant melanoma is around 70% . However, after one year, half of the patients who initially responded to this combined therapy develops secondary resistance. Among these patients, some also resist to anti-PD1 immunotherapy as single agent or in combination with anti-CTLA4. For these patients, the medical needs are huge since there is presently no effective alternative treatment. Resistance to targeted agents can be due to the presence of pre-existing rare resistant clones in heterogeneous tumor cell population or the stochastic acquisitions of drug resistance through genetic mutations under therapeutic selective pressures. The latter case is the most frequent, wherein some cells of an isogenic tumor cell-population survive in spite of the presence of anticancer drug(s). Such cells are defined as 'persistent cancer cells' and their survival capability is dependent on the presence of anticancer agents. I will discuss how persistent melanoma cells adaptively tolerate the treatment from the aspect of reversible mRNA translational reprogramming and accompanying metabolic rewiring, eventually how these aspects can be modelled in an agent-based stochastic modeling.

		    			The metaphor of the Waddington epigenetic landscape has become an iconic representation of the cellular differentiation process, in both health and disease. Recent accessibility of single-cell transcriptomic data has provided new opportunities for quantifying this originally conceptual tool that could offer insight into the gene regulatory networks underlying cellular development. Here, we highlight the complexities and limitations that arise when reconstructing the potential landscape in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We consider how the landscape changes in accordance with different stochastic systems, and show that it is the subtle interplay between the deterministic and stochastic components of the system that ultimately shapes the landscape.

		    			Metastasis, the process of cancerous cells invading multiple organs of the body, causes more than 90% of cancer-related deaths. No unique mutations could be associated with metastasis, and no cancer treatment so far can target metastasis. Recent studies suggest that metastasis is driven mainly by multiple interdependent axes of phenotypic plasticity, such as metabolic plasticity, drug resistance, dormancy, stemness, and Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). In particular, EMP – a developmental axis of phenotypic plasticity – is believed to be crucial for metastasis as it imparts the adherence and migratory characteristics to cancerous cells. Despite extensive physicochemical investigations, the mechanisms of the emergence of such phenotypic plasticity are still not understood. To understand these mechanisms, we take a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, we study the regulatory network topologies underlying EMP to identify characteristics that can give rise to plasticity. On the other hand, we construct models based on population dynamics data to understand the dynamics of switching and infer phenotypic plasticity mechanisms other than network topology, such as stochasticity, ecological interactions between various EMP phenotypes, and epigenetics. Our results suggest that the EMP networks have a high fraction of positive feedback loops, which can give rise to phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, small perturbations that reduce the number of positive feedback loops and increase the number of negative feedback loops can reduce phenotypic plasticity over a large parameter space.
