		    			Now, more than ever, pharmaceutical companies are relying on mathematical modeling & simulation to inform drug discovery and development decisions. In many cases, particularly for novel compounds, targets, and/or combinations, modelers must rely on incomplete data and/or extrapolation beyond existing data to address key questions, such as dose and dose regimen selection for clinical trials. In this talk, I will present a few case studies and related mathematical challenges that my team has faced and discuss why developing a better understanding of these problems is important in the context of drug discovery & development.

		    			In quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling, sensitivity analysis is often conducted to identify a set of sensitive parameters to avoid overparameterization for robust calibration and validation. There are different global sensitivity analysis methods to choose from. Furthermore, for each model output, sensitivity analysis generates a rank-ordered list. Combining individual lists of rank-ordered sensitive parameters from all model outputs in a QSP model to obtain the final list may be subject to modeler’s judgement. Capturing variability in a trial population through uncertainty analysis and virtual patient trials can improve the predictive performance of a model and inform trial designs for a drug development program. However, multiple different algorithms can be used. This talk will discuss methodological considerations when applying sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis to QSP modeling for drug development.

		    			Providing the optimal dosing strategy of a drug for an individual patient is an important task in pharmaceutical sciences and daily clinical application. By solving an optimal control problem (OCP) especially tailored to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models the optimal individualized dosing regimen can be computed for substantially different scenarios with various routes of administration.
The aim is to compute a control that brings the underlying system as closely as possible to a desired reference state by minimizing an objective function. In PKPD modeling the controls are the administered doses and the reference state can be the disease progression. Therefore, the objective function which shall be minimized is quantifying the difference between a desired disease state and the actual state generated by a particular treatment. Drug administration at certain time points gives a finite number of discrete controls, the drug doses, determining the drug concentration and its effect on the disease state. Hence, it is possible to construct a finite-dimensional OCP depending only on the doses and apply robust quasi-Newton algorithms from finite-dimensional optimization.

		    			Heterogeneity among individual patients presents a fundamental challenge to effective treatment, since a treatment protocol would only work for a portion of the population. We hypothesize that a computational pipeline integrating mathematical modelling and machine learning could be used to address this fundamental challenge and facilitate the optimization of individualized treatment protocols. We tested our hypothesis with the neuroendocrine systems controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. With a synergistic combination of mathematical modelling and machine learning, this integrated computational pipeline could indeed efficiently reveal optimal treatment targets that could significantly improve the treatment efficacy of a heterogeneous individuals, despite of the challenge that the simultaneous changes of multiple parameters result in complex dynamical patterns. Dynamical Analysis of the computational results then revealed mechanistic insights that connect heterogeneous behavior to model structure. We believe that this integrated computational pipeline, properly applied in combination with other computational, experimental and clinical research tools, can be used to optimize treatment targets against a broad range of complex diseases.
