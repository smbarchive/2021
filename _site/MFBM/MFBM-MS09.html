		    			Symmetries have long been used to understand when propulsion is possible in microscale systems.  Currently, artificially propelled magnetic micro- and nanoparticles are being utilized in a variety of techniques including hyperthermia, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging. Rotation of rigid magnetic particles by an external magnetic field is a promising category of such artificial propulsion.  Propulsion would seem to be prohibited by geometries with fore-aft symmetry along their rotation axis, such as a rotating sphere.  We have shown that in nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids, a symmetry breaking propulsion is possible for rotating microspheres.  We show that this propulsion occurs in both mucin and polyacrylamide solutions, and propose that it results from rod-climbing-like effects which squeeze the sphere and reinforce its translation.  A perturbative analysis of the forces on a rotating sphere in a nonlinear polymeric fluid corroborates this mechanism.

		    			Eukaryotic cells move in rheologically complex environments via deformations of their flagella, which are slender threadlike structures that are powered by internal molecular motors.  It is an ongoing scientific pursuit to determine how flagellar beat emerges from the coordination of the mechanics of the flagella, the interactions with the external fluid environment, and the mechano-chemical feedback of the molecular motors. Existing theories have shed light on the origins of this behavior in a viscous fluid, however, due to the inherent nonlinearity and mathematical complexity involved in modeling viscoelastic fluids, both analytical and numerical predictions require nonstandard approaches. In this work we propose an extension to the current models to make a prediction about how viscoelasticity changes the beat frequency of the emergent waveform.

		    			Microorganisms often navigate a complex environment composed of a viscous fluid with suspended microstructures such as elastic polymers and filamentous networks.  These microstructures can have similar length scales to the microorganisms, leading to complex swimming dynamics.  Some microorganisms are known to remodel the viscoelastic networks they move through. In order to gain insight into the coupling between swimming dynamics and network remodeling, we use a regularized Stokeslet boundary element method to compute the motion of a microswimmer consisting of a spherical body and rotating helical flagellum. The viscoelastic network is represented by a cloud of points with virtual Maxwell element links. We consider two models of network remodeling in which (1) links break based on their distance to the microswimmer body, modeling enzymatic dissolution by bacteria or microrobots, or (2) links break based on a threshold tension force. We compare the swimming performance of the microbes in each remodeling paradigm as they penetrate and move through the network.

		    			Peritrichously flagellated bacteria swim in a fluid environment by rotating motors embedded in the cell membrane and consequently rotating multiple helical flagella. We present a novel mathematical model of a microswimmer that can freely run propelled by a flagellar bundle and tumble upon motor reversals. Our cell model is composed of a rod-shaped rigid cell body and multiple flagella randomly distributed over the cell body. These flagella can go through polymorphic transformations. We demonstrate that flagellar bundling is influenced by flagellar distribution and hence the number of flagella. Moreover, reorientation of cells is affected by the number of flagella, how many flagella change their polymorphisms within a cell, the tumble timing, different combinations of polymorphic sequences, and random motor reversals. Our mathematical method can be applied to numerous types of microorganisms and may help to understand their characteristic swimming mechanisms.
