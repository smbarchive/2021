		    			We address the question of determining optimal chemotherapy strategies to prevent the growth of brain tumor population. To do so, we consider a reaction-diffusion model which describes the diffusion and proliferation of tumor cells and a minimization problem corresponding to it. It is established that the optimization problem admits a solution and we obtain a necessary condition for the minimizer . In a specific case, the optimizer is calculated explicitly, and we prove that it is unique. Then, a gradient-based efficient numerical algorithm is developed in order to determine the optimizer. Our results suggest a bang-bang chemotherapy strategy in a cycle which starts at the maximum dose and terminates with a rest period. Numerical simulations based upon our algorithm on a real brain image show that this is in line with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a standard chemotherapy protocol.

		    			The impact of animal dispersal on the total population abundance is one of the core issues in theoretical and applied ecology. In this talk, for the two-patch logistic model, we study how dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry affects the total population abundance. Two complete classifications of the model parameter space are given: one concerning when dispersal causes smaller or larger total biomass than no dispersal, and the other addressing how the total biomass changes with dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry. This improves some existing results, e.g., a recent work of Arditi et al. (Theor. Popul. Biol., 120: 11-15, 2018).

	    		<article class="article-post text-justify" style="font-size:12px;">
		    		
		    			A central question in spatial ecology is understanding the interplay between the different types of movement and (spatial) network topology in the dynamics of a metacommunity. However, this is not an easy task as most fragmented ecosystems have trophic interactions involving many species and complex path-way structures. Recent attempts to solve this challenge have introduced certain simplifying assumptions or focused on a limited set of examples. However, these results do not cover many real situations. The goal of the talk is to compare the influence of the different topologies for a given configuration of nodes on the population abundances of the species of a trophic metacommunity. In particular, we are able to describe optimal movements/topologies that maximize the total population size of a target species. Regarding methodology, we first distinguish between species with low and high mobility. In the first group, we analyze the role of each path in isolation. In the second, we study the kernel of a matrix obtained from the adjacency matrices. Our main result reveals that the influence of network topologies on the population abundances depends, to a great extent, on the movement time scale. Moreover, we will prove that some directed graphs are useful in maximising the population abundance of a target species. Our framework can be readily used with any metacommunity and, therefore, represents a unification of biological insights. Moreover, we shed light on some folkloric discussions such as the role of the symmetric movement or the number of paths of a landscape.

	    		<article class="article-post text-justify" style="font-size:12px;">
		    		
		    			We consider a diffusive logistic model of a single species in a heterogeneous environment, with two parameters, r(x) for intrinsic growth rate and K(x) for carrying capacity. When r(x) and K(x) are proportional, i.e., r=cK, it is proved by Prof. Lou Yuan that a population diffusing at any rate will reach a higher total equilibrium biomass than the population in an environment in which the same total resources are distributed homogeneously. In this talk, we study another case when r(x) is a constant, i.e., independent of K(x). In such case, a striking result is that for any dispersal rate, the logistic equation with spatially heterogeneous resources will always support a total population strictly smaller than the total carrying capacity at equilibrium, which is just opposite to the case r = cK. These two cases of single species models also lead to two different forms of Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion systems. We then report the consequences of the aforementioned difference on the two corresponding forms of the competition systems. Our results indicate that in heterogeneous environments, the correlation between r(x) and K(x) has more profound impacts in population ecology then we had previously expected, at least from a mathematical point of view. This is joint work with Qian Guo and Prof. Wei-Ming Ni.
