title: "COVID-19 dynamics in the Basque Country: towards spatially dependent models"
abstract: "More than one year after the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ongoing pandemic continues to affect the lives of people around the globe. Better understanding of the challenges posed by this virus are key to face the future with the right amount of caution, to guide current and future public health policies, and to inform the public to avoid the spreading of misinformation and fear. Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission have played (and will continue to play) an important role in this direction. In this talk, I will outline the development of the pandemic in the Basque Country, a compartmental modelling framework to describe the local reality (accounting for the basque government response in different stages of the pandemic), and discuss possible approaches to account for spatially refined information providing further insights into the local transmission dynamics."
