title: "Dimensionality affects extinction of bistable populations"
abstract: "The question of whether biological populations survive or are eventually driven to extinction has long been examined using mathematical models. In this work we study population survival or extinction using a stochastic, discrete lattice-based random walk model where individuals undergo movement, birth and death events. The discrete model is defined on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions. A key feature of the discrete model is that crowding effects are introduced by specifying two different crowding functions that govern how local agent density influences movement events and birth/death events. The continuum limit description of the discrete model is a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, and in this work we focus on crowding functions that lead to linear diffusion and a bistable reaction term that is often associated with the strong Allee effect. Using both the discrete and continuum modelling tools we explore the complicated relationship between the long-term survival or extinction of the population and the initial spatial arrangement of the population. Our results indicate that dimensionality of the initial population distributions affects extinction of bistable populations."
