title: "Numerical simulation of the pattern formation in reaction-diffusion equations on time-stepped moving curved surfaces"
abstract: "In this talk, we present an explicit time-dependent numerical scheme for the pattern formation in reaction-diffusion equations on time-stepped moving curved surfaces. The proposed method is consisting of discretization scheme of Laplace-Beltrami operator over triangulated surfaces. We conduct several numerical experiments to demonstrate a growing domain effect, and pattern formations by the proposed numerical method."
