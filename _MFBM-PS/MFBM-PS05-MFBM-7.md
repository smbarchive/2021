title: "Unified approach for in vitro data based parameters estimation"
abstract: "Our aim was to develop a unified approach to parameters estimation from the in vitro data and its implementation in an upgrade of the Immune Response Template (IRT). IRT is QSP platform of the immune system and a tool for the development of QSP and mechanistic models related to immunity. The core of IRT is an ordinary differential equations-based model describing immune cells cycle processes, cytokines secretion and surface molecules interaction. Model parameters may be assessed from the in vitro experiments with typical design for cells survival, proliferation, migration, etc. We derived formulas for direct parameters calculation from the in vitro data for apoptosis, proliferation, migration, differentiation and cytokine synthesis.Typical in vitro experiments were modeled, processes were described with an approach from [1]. Derived formulas allow direct calculation of parameters from the in vitro data, resulting in a reduction of a model development time. Developed formulas were used in parameter identification for IRT version 3 and 3.1, allowing the calculation of nearly 950 parameters directly from the in vitro data.1. Mechanistic approach to describe multiple effects of regulatory molecules on cell dynamics process in immune response.
