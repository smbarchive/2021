title: "A computational systems biology approach identifies SLUG as a mediator of partial Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)"
abstract: "Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity comprises of reversible transitions among epithelial, hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) and mesenchymal phenotypes, and underlies various aspects of aggressive tumor progression such as metastasis, therapy resistance and immune evasion. The process of cells attaining one or more hybrid E/M phenotypes is termed as partial EMT. Cells in hybrid E/M phenotype(s) can be more aggressive than those in either fully epithelial or mesenchymal state. Thus, identifying regulators of hybrid E/M phenotypes is essential to decipher the rheostats of phenotypic plasticity and consequent accelerators of metastasis. Here, using a computational systems biology approach, we demonstrate that SLUG (SNAIL2) – an EMT-inducing transcription factor – can inhibit cells from undergoing a complete EMT and thus stabilizing them in hybrid E/M phenotype(s). It expands the parametric range enabling the existence of a hybrid E/M phenotype, thereby behaving as a phenotypic stability factor (PSF). Our simulations suggest that this specific property of SLUG emerges from the topology of the regulatory network it forms with other key regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. Clinical data suggests that SLUG associates with worse patient prognosis across multiple carcinomas. Together, our results indicate that SLUG can stabilize hybrid E/M phenotype(s)."
