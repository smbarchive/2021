title: "Accelerate Replication Fork velocity to kill cancer cells"
abstract: "Replication fork plays an important role during DNA replication. During DNA replication Fork movement rate increases during S phase in mammalian cells and also reduces during replication stress. There exists a molecular mechanism through which the replication fork adjusts their speeds during the S phase. In cancer cells, DNA replication is slower compared to normal cells and replication forks move slowly. So, this work proposes that if the replication fork speed can cross a particular threshold, the cancer cells won't be able to cope with the DNA replication and die in the process. A mechanistic mathematical model has been developed based on recent experimental findings. Mec1, Rad53 and Mrc1 are needed to create a positive feedback loop to stabilize replisome during stalled forks."
