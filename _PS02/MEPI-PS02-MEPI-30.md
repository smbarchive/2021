title: "A SEI model with nonlinear incidence rate: global stability analysis"
abstract: "We propose a SEI epidemic model where the infected and the exposed are the spreaders of the disease. Besides, a general nonlinear incidence rate and death rate functions are considered to study the stability of the model. We prove that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number R0 is greater than unity and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0 is lower than unity."
