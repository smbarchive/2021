title: "Modeling the effect of multiple vaccines on the spread of SARS-CoV-2"
abstract: "Several different vaccines have been introduced to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. As the virus is capable of mutating to escape the protection given by the vaccine, using multiple vaccines is believed to help prevent the virus from mutating to escape all vaccines, helping to combat spread of the virus. We simulate the effect of using multiple vaccines on the virus using a mathematical model. With the model, we can better understand the effect of multiple types of vaccines in helping to control pandemics."
