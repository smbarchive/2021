title: "Evolutionarily stable aposematic signalling in prey-predator systems where the prey population consists of one species."
abstract: "Aposematism is the signalling of a defence for the deterrence of predators. Our research focuses on aposematic organisms that exhibit chemical defences, which are usually signalled by bright skin pigmentation; although our treatment is likely transferable to other forms of secondary defence. This setup is a natural one to consider and opens up the possibility for robust mathematical modelling: the strength of aposematic traits (signalling and defence) can be unambiguously realised using variables that are continuously quantifiable, independent from one another and which together define a two-dimensional strategy space. We develop a mathematical model and explore the joint co-evolution of aposematic traits within the context of evolutionary stability. Even though empirical and model-based studies are conflicting regarding how aposematic traits are related to one another in nature, most allude to a positive correlation. We suggest that both positively and negatively correlated combinations of traits can achieve evolutionarily stable outcomes and further, that for a given level of signal strength there can be more than one optimal level of defence. Our findings are novel and relevant to a sizeable body of physical evidence, much of which could, until presently, not be addressed in terms of a single, well-understood mechanism."
