title: "Viral coinfection interaction through interferon"
abstract: "Coinfection affects up to 60% of patients hospitalized influenza-like illnesses, however, the role of the innate immune response in coinfections is not understood. Interferons, part of the innate immune response, are a type of chemical released by infected cells that can help establish an antiviral state in cells by increasing resistance to infection and reducing production of viruses. Although the increased resistance to infection can help suppress both viruses, the reduction in the production of one virus may aid in increasing the growth of another virus during coinfection due to less competition. We will use a mathematical model to examine the interaction via interferons between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) during coinfections. This model will measure viral titer, duration of the viral infection, and interferon production allowing us to understand how interferon production of one virus helps or hinders the secondary virus."
