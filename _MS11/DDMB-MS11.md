title: "Mathematical Modeling of Protein Dynamics"
organizers: "Suzanne S. SINDI (University of California, Merced, USA)"
description: "Proteins are fundamental building blocks of life. Their dynamics - both with respect to folding and their spatio-temporal dynamics - are critical to the normal function of biological systems. When proteins misfold, they are often associated with disease. For example, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, results from the accumulation and aggregation of incorrectly folded proteins. These diseases can be genetic or spontaneous and in the special case of prion disease infectious. 
This minisymposium brings together researchers (biologists, biophysicists and mathematicians) with the goal of exploring the latest approaches (both experimental and mathematical) for studying protein dynamics, with a particular emphasis on protein misfolding diseases."

title2: "Growth fragmention models to understand the dynamical instabilities of microtubules"
abstract2: "Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein polymers that are found in all eukaryotic cells. They are crucial for normal cell development, aiding in many cellular processes, including cell division, cell polarisation, and cell motility .  Because of their role in cell movement and cell division, these polymers are often used as targets for a variety of cancer chemotherapy drugs. Many experimental studies have been completed to understand MT dynamics , and how these dynamics are altered by the addition of MT targeting drugs. However, a complete understanding of such dynamics is lacking, and so the development of new theoretical models to describe MT dynamics is important. We propose in this talk a mathematical model based on growth-fragmentation PDE and investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions"

title3: "OvPrP oligomers - a short story of structural diversity"
abstract3: "In this presentation we explore the structural diversity of small OvPrP oligomers. These objects formed in vitro exhibit a surprisingly wide variety of structures and organisations. Using various experimental methods, we are able to devise hypotheses regarding the origin of this diversity and the interactions between the different species. In particular, we study a specific mutant of OvPrP, which selectively creates one type of object. We build a kinetic model for the dynamics of these objects, with the goal to reproduce two crucial qualitative features of the experiments: 1) a non-linear and non-monotonous effect of concentration 2) the interaction between multiple timescales.  Novel processes are included in order to obtain this qualitative behaviour, and the importance of structural diversity in the replication of oligomers is evidenced."

title4: "Activation of OAS2 by dsRNA"
abstract4: "The activation of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzymes by direct interaction with viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a key part of the innate immune response to viral infection. A downstream effect of the OAS-dsRNA interaction is to degrade the single-stranded RNA to prevent the spread of the virus. The activation of OAS2, one of the members of the OAS family, depends on dsRNA length. Combining in vitro experiments and mathematical modelling, we test different hypotheses for the OAS2 activation mechanisms by its cofactor dsRNA. After model calibration and selection, the cooperative binding of multiple OAS2 to a single dsRNA is shown to best represent the effect of its cofactor length on enzyme activity.
