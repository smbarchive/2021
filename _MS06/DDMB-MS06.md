description: "Biochemical interaction networks are commonly modeled by systems of differential equations that may involve large numbers of variables and unknown parameters. This minisymposium focuses on recent work tackling the analysis of such systems. The underlying theme of the talks is the study of how the structure of the network influences its range of dynamical behaviors, and the investigation of parameter regimes where these behaviours arise. Examples regard multistationarity, oscillatory behavior or absolute concentration robustness."

title1: "Oscillations in deficiency-one mass-action systems"
abstract1: "Whereas the positive equilibrium of a mass-action system with deficiency zero is always globally stable, for deficiency-one networks there are many different scenarios, mainly involving oscillatory behaviour. We present examples with centers or multiple limit cycles."

title2: "Detecting concentration robustness in Reaction Networks"
abstract2: "A biological system has absolute concentration robustness (ACR) for some species if the concentration of this species is identical at any possible equilibrium that the network admits. In particular, this concentration must be independent of the initial conditions. While some classes of networks with ACR have been described, as well as some techniques to check ACR for a given network, finding networks with this property is a difficult task in general. 

The connection of this global version of robustness with other local notions leads to a practical test on necessary conditions for ACR, by means of algebraic-geometric techniques. This test allows to analyze networks in the search for the possibility of ACR or local ACR for some values of the reaction rates, or discard it for all values. This is based on joint work with E. Feliu."

title3: "Global convergence to steady states in a model for the in-host dynamics of hepatitis C"
abstract3: "We consider a model for the concentration of hepatitis C virus
particles in a host which includes a simple description of the virus
replication. This model has two virus-free steady states and two
corresponding basic reproduction numbers. It has at most three positive
steady states. Although it is not known whether there can be more than one
steady state we prove that for certain ranges of the parameters every
solution converges to a steady state. This is accomplished by applying
a method of Li and Muldowney which uses the Lozinskii measure corresponding
to a certain norm. An estimate for this Lozinskii measure of the second
additive compound of the Jacobian matrix is the key condition which is
required. The central idea of the method is to exclude all other kinds of
asymptotic behaviour, such as convergence to a periodic solution."

title4: "Building Reaction Networks with Prescribed Properties"
abstract4: "In general, the problem of identifying reaction networks with some prescribed dynamical property is challenging. As an example of a dynamical property, let's consider stable oscillation. The question then becomes: does a given network allow stable oscillation for some choice of parameters (e.g., rate constants if the reaction network has mass action kinetics)? As networks grow in size, this question becomes harder and harder to check numerically. One way of making progress is via theorems which tell us how, given an oscillatory network, we can build a larger oscillatory network with more species or reactions. I'll give an overview of such theorems, focussing mainly on oscillation."
