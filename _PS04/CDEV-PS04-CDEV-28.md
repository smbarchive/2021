title: "Modeling Chromosome Dynamics During Prophase I of Meiosis"
abstract: "This study describes a mathematical model for dynamics between chromosomes in the cell nucleus, with a primary aim to predict matching times for homologous chromosomes. The pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis allows for the exchange of genetic material and proper chromosome segregation during cell splitting. Hence, in order to elucidate meiotic defects that can lead to miscarriages or birth defects, it is crucial to understand this significant process. While homolog pairing can be monitored in the laboratory, the same cell cannot be followed for the duration of pairing. Cell samples die upon analysis, and thus different cells are evaluated at each timepoint. By simulating chromosome dynamics based on experimental data, we can track chromosome movement within one cell for the duration of pairing. Our agent-based model of chromosome dynamics involves capturing chromosome self-propulsion, collision dynamics, and thermal noise within the nucleus. The results are compared to the experimental data, and we observe the same pairing pattern. Our model validates the experimental method and strengthens the results. This model may then provide insight into the effects of mutations on pairing."
