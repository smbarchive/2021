title: "Diffusion on Dynamical Networks with Applications to Cell Biology"
abstract: "The topic of research is the membranous networks of endoplasmic reticulum that transport proteins. The goal of the research is to develop accurate computational models to make inferences on the intended destination of a protein based on changes within the network. The morphology of these networks is a mysterious topic that only now may be uncovered with advances in technology and computing. One of the sub-goals is to accurately model the types of change that occur in these networks, through the discoveries made with testing on artificial networks. This is an important topic as it sheds light on the interactions that occur inside a cell and thus will help to understand how natural networks make decisions."
