title: "Evaluating the effect of non pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 infection dynamics through agent based models"
abstract: "In order to provide both qualitative and quantitative results regarding the efficacy of non pharmaceutical interventions, we use an agent based model, considering typical epidemiological parameter distributions for COVID-19 in an age-stratified population in each case. We suppose individuals can assume the following states: susceptible, asymptomatic, infected, exposed, recovered and dead. They move and exchange contact inside a defined area. Introducing agglomeration sites and social distancing, we evaluate the effect of different non pharmaceutical interventions through simulation results of attack rate, death rate and epidemic curves created in each scenario. Lastly, we suppose the interventions are lifted at a given time and evaluate how the duration of interventions change the infection dynamics."
