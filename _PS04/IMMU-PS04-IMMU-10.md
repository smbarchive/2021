title: "Incorporating Symptom Scores into Viral Kinetic Models"
abstract: "Previous studies indicate that there is a correlation between the amount of virus produced by a patient (the viral load) and the severity of the disease as indicated by their symptoms. We examine the correlation between symptom score and viral load for several viral respiratory infections. We then incorporate a prediction of symptom scores into mathematical models of viral growth and test the validity and applicability of these models to data from influenza A and other viral infections."
