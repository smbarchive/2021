description: "This mini-symposium aims to bring together researchers in biomathematics who work with mathematical modeling of water resources management. We intend to provide the interaction of researchers who work in the modeling of water resources, whether in hydroelectric reservoirs seeking to balance nature with economic needs, or in ponds and rivers seeking to preserve the biodiversity and the economy existing in the place. The idea is to provide an environment for discussing existing forms and mathematical models to simulate the flow and growth control of animals and plants in reservoirs, rivers, lakes and ponds. Exchange experiences on how mathematical modeling can assist in the actions of protection, conservation and improvement of environmental quality and natural systems of water resources. In addition, of course, to be a good resource to guide and order the process of economic occupation, aiming at improving the quality of economic and environmental interaction."

title1: "How to convince policymakers that uncertainty exists: do mathematical models help or confuse?"
abstract1: "Policy makers have two problems when trying to make decisions about ecosystems, especially when these decisions involve aquatic resources: 1) They have problems to visualize the non-linear nature of ecological systems. This is important because the responses of aquatic ecosystems to exploitation or pollution can be abrupt and unpredictable. 2) They tend to think in terms of exact values and accurate predictions. This is serious because when we do not consider uncertainty and variability we do not adequately assess risks. I will show from two examples how these ideas can be corrected using mathematical models and how the results of those models should be adequately communicated to decision makers in order to clarify the concepts instead of confusing them even more."

title2: "Water quality and environmental and ecological risks"
abstract2: "My intention is that of presenting a situation which has been occurring in Brazil in recent years and which seriously affects water quality in hydrographic basins: tailings dams failures and their consequences both in immediate as well as long standing terms to the present and the future of nature and society. I will present the main results in terms of mathematically modeling aspects of dam failures and impact upon waterways undertaken by the Mathematical Engineering subgroup at the State University of Campinas the researching of which is part of a larger effort with two other subgroups: Society and Education, and Geophysical and Biotic Environments which form the Global Effort for Research and Action in Conflicts, Risks and Impacts associated to Tailings Dams (CRIAB)."

title3: "Populacional Density Model of Limnoperna Fortunei for Três Irmãos Hydroelectric – São Paulo, Brasil"
abstract3: "The golden mussel is an invasive species in Brazil which causes great environmental and economic problems, including the displacement of native species, modification of natural habitats and damage to equipments in hydroelectric power plants and water treatment systems. The main objective of this research was to establish a method for the quick quantification of Golden Mussel populations in hydroelectric reservoirs in order to monitor the species and eventually employ control methods to combat this invasion. A hydrodynamic model of the area of the HPP Três Irmãos (São Paulo State) was created using Navier Stokes equations applied to a grid of triangular finite elements. The hydrodynamic model was then combined with a population growth model using a system of partial differential equations. The resulting map of population density clusters of the golden mussel matches field observations and shows the potential of this technique to control and monitor species in a large scale."

title4: "3D Numerical Modeling of Dambreak Problems using Finite Element Method"
abstract4: "Dams to store water, mud and mining sediments represent import civil engineering structures. Due to the scale of such large structures, any accident has severe social and ecconomical impacts in the surrouding areas. The simulation of dam break problems has emerged as an important tool to predict the impact of this kind of accidents. In this work, it is presented EdgeCFD: a numerical tool capable to simulate dam break problems. This tool employs a RB-VMS finite element formulation to simulate 3D incompressible fluid flow of Newtonian or non-Newtonian flows. In order to allows for high fidelity simulations, EdgeCFD is capable to run large scale parallel simulations using distributed and/or shared memory machines and state of art non-linear algorithms.
