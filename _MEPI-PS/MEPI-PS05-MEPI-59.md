title: " Modelling COVID-19 in Nepal: Effectiveness of Control Measures"
abstract: "While most of the countries around the globe are combating with the pandemic of COVID-19, the level of its impact is quite variable among different countries. In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, have shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). In this presentation, I will describe the biphasic epidemic pattern of Nepal via a mathematical model and analyze the effectiveness of the control strategies implemented in Nepal."
