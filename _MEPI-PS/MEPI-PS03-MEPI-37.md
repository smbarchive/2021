title: "Game theoretic approach to quantify the impact of ITNs under individuals choice on malaria transmission"
abstract: "Insecticide Treated bed Nets (ITN) have proven to be highly effective control measure to reduce malaria transmission. It has been discussed earlier that ITNs with high efficacy may perform better in control malaria. But, even after massive distribution of ITN, malaria persists in most of the under developing countries, compromising the long term malaria elimination goals. However, many empirical studies pointed out that usage of ITN plays an important role in its effectiveness to control malaria. Individuals ITN usage are highly driven by ITN efficacy, mosquito density due to seasonal variation, replacement period, increment in daily productivity due to ITN misuse. To explore the complex interaction of ITN usage pattern and malaria prevalence, we develop a Game-Theoretic model of ITN usage and malaria transmission. Our results show the impact of parameters like imitation rate and ITN efficacy on human behaviour are critical. The analysis indicates that higher efficacy of ITN is not always optimal to control malaria effectively, which is an important information for malaria elimination strategies."
