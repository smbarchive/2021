title: "Quantifying the effectiveness of quarantine measures"
abstract: "Using a SEIR model we evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic in various states. We assume a changing infection rate to reflect the restrictions put into place to combat spread of the infection. Doing this allows us to mathematically represent the changes in behavior and restrictions in actions after the outbreak of COVID-19 and how they affected the spread of COVID-19. We test different formulations for the changing infection rate, from abrupt change to gradual decay of the infection rate to determine how best to model changes due to various mandates. This analysis helps us understand the effectiveness of different preventative measures found across the U.S so that the pandemic is stopped and dealt with effectively."
