title: "Quantifying Compliance with COVID-19 Mitigation Policies in the US"
abstract: "The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. In response to this global pandemic, governments in the United States had implemented COVID-19 mitigation policies. However, those policies, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, and its compliance, have varied across the states, which led to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 spread. This study aims to proposea spatio-temporal model for quantifying compliance with the US COVID-19 mitigation policies at a regional level. To achieve this goal, a partial differential equation is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among state clusters and human mobilities on the transmission of COVID-19. The model may inform policymakers as they decide how to react to future outbreaks."
