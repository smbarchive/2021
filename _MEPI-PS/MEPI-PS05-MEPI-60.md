title: "Modeling Imported malaria in Nepal with control strategies"
abstract: "The cross-border mobility of seasonal migrant workers between Nepal and India is a major challenge for the malaria elimination program of Nepal. Having the open border provision with highly endemic country of malaria India, most of the recorded malaria cases of Nepal are imported. Here, we proposed a malaria model including control strategies to protect the migrant workers from mosquito biting during their stay in India. Moreover, we will analyze the backward bifurcation and level of control strategies for the elimination of malaria in Nepal by 2026"
