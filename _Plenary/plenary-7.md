title: "Models and methods for studying cell polarity establishment and gradient sensing"
affiliation: "Professor of Pharmacology"
abstract: "Cells polarize their growth or movement in the direction of chemical gradients in many different physiological contexts. A key driver of polarity is the Rho GTPase Cdc42, which when activated becomes clustered or concentrated at polar sites. We present models to describe the polarity process and the mechanisms that allow yeast to reorient their polarity site toward chemical gradients. We also present a novel approach for performing spatial Gillespie simulations of the polarization process with improved accuracy. Finally, we present preliminary results that suggest the mechanisms that underlie polarity establishment in yeast may also play a role in the early events of phagocytosis."
