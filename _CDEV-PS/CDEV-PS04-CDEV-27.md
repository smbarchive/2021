title: "Stripe Heterogeneity Affects Global Coordination of Oscillations in Synthetic Microbial Consortia"
abstract: "Researchers recently utilized a sixteen delay-differential equations model to investigate globally-linked oscillations in two-strain, synthetic microbial consortia. Naturally, their model's complexity makes it challenging to comprehend and analyze, both analytically and numerically. In this presentation, we will discuss the work we have done towards developing a much simpler, non-dimensionalized model consisting of two diffusion equations based on one of the strain's underlying network topology. We will show that our model captures the consortia's qualitative behavior and is more suitable for analysis."
