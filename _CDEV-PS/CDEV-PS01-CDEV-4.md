title: "Modeling the liver circadian clock control by nutrients"
abstract: "Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles in physiological processes. On a molecular level, the circadian clock is regulated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops. Experiments in recent years on mammalian circadian clocks have shown that external factors such as diet, nutrients and even blood gas concentrations have effects on circadian period, amplitude, and phase. Molecular players linked to these external factors have been found to regulate and be regulated by the circadian clock. In this work, we have developed a mathematical model to study the effect of high fat diet and nutrients on the liver circadian clock. The model interlinks feeding and fasting cycle and circadian clock and provide insights into the regulation by external factors."
