title: "Energetic cost of the cross-talk between calcium dynamics and mitochondrial metabolism"
abstract: "Ion exchanges across mitochondrial membrane play a crucial role for energy metabolism [1–2]. In this work, we focus on the interplay between Ca2+ dynamics and mitochondrial metabolism. Ca2+ activates different enzymes of the TCA cycle and thereby enhances ATP production, while Ca2+ exchanges via SERCA and PMCA pumps are consuming ATP. The kinetics of this coupling has been studied with mathematical modelling [3–5], but its concrete energetic cost remains elusive. Here, we investigate this cost computationally by means of the entropy production rate (EPR) of Ca2+ exchanges and major mitochondrial metabolic processes. We show that the EPR as a measure for the throughput of the Gibbs free enthalpy of the TCA cycle exhibits a maximum in dependence on the glucose level, which could represent an optimal working regime of cells.  1.
