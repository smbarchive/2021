title: "A Mathematical Analysis of Focal Adhesion Lifetimes and Their Effect on Cell Motility"
abstract: "Active cell motion is a fundamental process for most living organisms.  It is crucial for embryogenesis, pathologies such as fighting infections or the spread of cancer, and single cell organisms in finding favorable environments. In this research we analyze data regarding a subprocess of amoeboid cell motion - the lifetime of focal adhesions (FAs).  Cells attach to and gain traction from the extracellular matrix via FAs. We collect and analyze existing FA lifetime data and find that it is gamma distributed.  We also find that cell speed decreases as the mean FA lifetime increases. Mathematical modeling suggests that the detach-rate is both force and time dependent."
