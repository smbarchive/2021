title: " Emergent behavior across scales: locomotion, mixing, and collective motion in active swimmers"
organizers: "Robert Guy (University of California Davis, United States), Arvind Gopinath (University of California Merced, United States)"
description: "This minisymposium focuses on emergent and novel multi-scale behavior in active swimmer systems. The first part of the minisymposium focuses on the locomotion of single swimmers. Many living micro-organisms move by coordinated movements of flagella. While some artificial microswimmers mimic these movements, alternative designs that leverage instabilities of the ambient media are possible. Synchronous flagellar beats result from the coupling between flagella elasticity, ambient fluid properties and internal motor driven activity. Synthetic swimmers may similarly be realized by coupling external driving forces to body elasticity and fluid rheology. Research is presented on how fluid rheology enables flagellar beats, novel swimming strategies that exploit symmetry breaking, and methods for studying swimmers. 

The second part of the mini-symposium features talks on the collective behavior of microswimmers and associated mixing flows. Mixing fluids at small scales is challenging given the lack of inertia, yet mixing is needed in many microfluidic settings. Research is presented on sorting (unmixing) in bacterial suspensions, mixing flows originating from microorganism interactions or instabilities in complex fluids, and on chemical reactions related to the emergence of life in microfluidic experiments."

title1: "Symmetry breaking propulsion of magnetically rotated spheres in nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids"
abstract1: "Symmetries have long been used to understand when propulsion is possible in microscale systems.  Currently, artificially propelled magnetic micro- and nanoparticles are being utilized in a variety of techniques including hyperthermia, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging. Rotation of rigid magnetic particles by an external magnetic field is a promising category of such artificial propulsion.  Propulsion would seem to be prohibited by geometries with fore-aft symmetry along their rotation axis, such as a rotating sphere.  We have shown that in nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids, a symmetry breaking propulsion is possible for rotating microspheres.  We show that this propulsion occurs in both mucin and polyacrylamide solutions, and propose that it results from rod-climbing-like effects which squeeze the sphere and reinforce its translation.  A perturbative analysis of the forces on a rotating sphere in a nonlinear polymeric fluid corroborates this mechanism."

title2: "Emergent Properties of Flagellar Waveforms in Viscoelastic Fluids"
abstract2: "Eukaryotic cells move in rheologically complex environments via deformations of their flagella, which are slender threadlike structures that are powered by internal molecular motors.  It is an ongoing scientific pursuit to determine how flagellar beat emerges from the coordination of the mechanics of the flagella, the interactions with the external fluid environment, and the mechano-chemical feedback of the molecular motors. Existing theories have shed light on the origins of this behavior in a viscous fluid, however, due to the inherent nonlinearity and mathematical complexity involved in modeling viscoelastic fluids, both analytical and numerical predictions require nonstandard approaches. In this work we propose an extension to the current models to make a prediction about how viscoelasticity changes the beat frequency of the emergent waveform."

title3: "Viscoelastic Network Remodeling by Microswimmers"
abstract3: "Microorganisms often navigate a complex environment composed of a
viscous fluid with suspended microstructures such as elastic polymers
and filamentous networks.  These microstructures can have similar
length scales to the microorganisms, leading to complex swimming
dynamics.  Some microorganisms are known to remodel the viscoelastic
networks they move through. In order to gain insight into the coupling
between swimming dynamics and network remodeling, we use a regularized
Stokeslet boundary element method to compute the motion of a
microswimmer consisting of a spherical body and rotating helical
flagellum. The viscoelastic network is represented by a cloud of
points with virtual Maxwell element links. We consider two models of
network remodeling in which (1) links break based on their distance to
the microswimmer body, modeling enzymatic dissolution by bacteria or
microrobots, or (2) links break based on a threshold tension force.
We compare the swimming performance of the microbes in each remodeling
paradigm as they penetrate and move through the network."

title4: "Simulations of microswimmers propelled by multiple flagella"
abstract4: "Peritrichously flagellated bacteria swim in a fluid
environment by rotating motors embedded in the cell membrane and
consequently rotating multiple helical flagella. We present a novel
mathematical model of a microswimmer that can freely run propelled by
a flagellar bundle and tumble upon motor reversals. Our cell model is
composed of a rod-shaped rigid cell body and multiple flagella
randomly distributed over the cell body. These flagella can go through
polymorphic transformations. We demonstrate that flagellar bundling is
influenced by flagellar distribution and hence the number of
flagella. Moreover, reorientation of cells is affected by the number
of flagella, how many flagella change their polymorphisms within a
cell, the tumble timing, different combinations of polymorphic
sequences, and random motor reversals. Our mathematical method can be
applied to numerous types of microorganisms and may help to understand
their characteristic swimming mechanisms."
